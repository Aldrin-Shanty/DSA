# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

Welcome to the DSA repository! This repository contains a collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms in Python. The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive set of examples and implementations to aid in learning and understanding data structures and algorithms.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following subfolders:

- **Data_Structures**: Contains implementations of various data structures, including:

  - Stack (single, circular, double)
  - Queue (single, circular, double)
  - Linked List (singly, doubly)
  - Hash Tables
  - Binary Heap (min, max)
  - Binary Search Tree
  - AVL Tree
  - Graph (adjacency matrix, adjacency list, Kruskal’s, Prim’s, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra’s, DFS, BFS)
  - Trie
  - Segment Tree
  - Fenwick Tree
  - Suffix Array
  - Red-Black Tree
  - Fibonacci Heap
  - Skip List
  - B Tree
  - B+ Tree

- **Search_Sort**: Contains implementations of various search and sort algorithms, including:

  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Radix Sort
  - Bucket Sort
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

- **Misc_Algo**: Contains implementations of miscellaneous algorithms, currently including:
  - **Dynamic_Programming**:
    - Knapsack 0/1
    - Matrix Chain Multiplication
    - Multi-Stage Graph

## Getting Started

To use the implementations in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aldrin-Shanty/DSA.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired folder**:

   ```bash
   cd DSA/Data_Structures
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   cd DSA/Search_Sort
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   cd DSA/Misc_Algo/Dynamic_Programming
   ```

3. **Run the Python scripts to see the implementations in action. For example**:

   ```bash
   python3 stack.py
   ```

   Replace stack.py with the file you want to execute.
